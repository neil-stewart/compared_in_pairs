# Code and data for Noguchi and Stewart (2014)

Noguchi, T., & Stewart, N. (2014). In the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects, alternatives are repeatedly compared in pairs on single dimensions. Cognition, 132, 44â€“56. [doi: 10.1016/            j.cognition.2014.03.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.006)

## Choice Data

The database [data.sqlite3](data.sqlite3) contains four tables: instruction, choiceset, participant and trial. The first two tables, instruction and choiceset, contain the materials used in the experiment: the instruction table records text messages presented at each trial, and the choiceset table records values of alternatives. The other two tables, participant and trial, contain the collected data: the participant table records whether participant was engaged in the task, and the trial table records participants' responses. The [R script](script.R) shows how to load the collected data onto a single data frame.
Dependencies

The R script uses the following libraries:

RSQLite [https://github.com/rstats-db/RSQLite](https://github.com/rstats-db/RSQLite)

Hmisc [http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/Hmisc](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/Hmisc)

dplyr [https://github.com/hadley/dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr)

tidyr [https://github.com/hadley/tidyr](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr)

ggplot2 [http://ggplot2.org/](http://ggplot2.org/)


## Fixation Data

The sqlite3 database [fixation.sqlite3](fixation.sqlite3) contains one table: fixation. This table has 6 columns:

* participant_id
* trial
* within_trial_index: 0 indicates the first fixation after the trial onset, 1 indicates the second fixation, 2 indicates the third fixation, and so on
* alternative
* attribute
* duration: fixation duration in milliseconds
